                I love to program but AI has always been a strugle as not understanding the math made me feel like it was not truly my work. So at last I learned how it 
                operated and not only that but worked on imporving it. To the right is my senior thesis about my initial reseach into artifical inteligence and my attempts at improving effecency.
                While non of my discoveryies are large this reseach has shown promis and more will follow.

                After my thesis I started exploring reinforment learning as while I have never needed it for a project I find the potential intersting.
                the idea of a computer learning based on an enviorment is amazing and I wanted to learn how. This exploration into Reinfroment learning was for my
                senior project and as of right now is not complete.
