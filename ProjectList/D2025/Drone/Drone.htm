            <p>The drone project is the first programming project I started and is still being worked on. 
                My first version had all the wrong parts and used Python, but version 3 is finally heading in the right direction. 
                This project started in my freshman year of high school, and I had no idea what programming was.
                 When I discovered what it could do, the first thing I wanted to do was to create a drone flight controller,
                  which has led me down a path of discovery to this day. 
                  Version one didn’t have a frame;
                   it basically consisted of just trying to find parts that might work and figuring out how to get them to work with small microcontenders.
                    Version two was much the same as the first few stabilization test but at this point, it was running on Arudino a version of C++. 
                    Now it is my senior year of high school, and I am attempting to get Version 3 of the flight controller working. </p>
                    <p>The third version of this drone has over three years of programming experience and several upgrades. 
                        First, it finally has a remote that allows for much easier and safer testing. 
                        This version also has a new frame 3D printed on a Reality K1 Max, which has a big enough build volume for the hole frame. 
                        Last but most importantly, the controller is no longer a ball of wires falling apart but a soldered temporary PCB.</p>

            <p>The second version of the frame is much the same as the second. 
                It follows a square profile to allow for easier stabilization while keeping each prop at the same distance from the center.
                 It has simple cutouts for electronics, in this case, all the way through, allowing for the center of the mass. 
                This frame is slightly smaller and lighter while being stronger.
                 This added strength is because it was all 3d printed at once.</p>
            <p>This frame was printed on a Creality K1 max, giving plenty of room for the full frame. 
                This frame, unlike version two, does not have detachable arms.
                 This reduced odd rattling in the arms while making it stronger and the prints easier. 
                This frame is still printed in PLA, which will likely cause issues later on but makes modifications easy. </p>
                <p>While the main frame is printed all in one piece, there were several additions. 
                    This frame was printed to help with consistency which means attaching thighs without electrical tape.
                     To mount the batter, ESC, and to keep the wires form getting into the blade clips were added.
                      The frame had noches on the arms and body to allow for 3D printed clips to hold wires and other electronics to the frame.
                     These don’t add strength, but they do make everything more consistent.</p>
