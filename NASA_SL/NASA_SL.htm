        <header>Proposal</header>
        <div class="sidebyside">
            <div class="sidebysideobject"><p>The proposal was started during the summer before the senior year of highschool. With the help of Alex Larson & Liam Lacy
                we finished our proposal in the first few weeks of school and submited it to NASA. The point of this proposal was to show we knew what we were doing
                and had a resable plan of how to attain our goal. We proposed to launch a rocket with the ability to deploy a plane at high altidude that could conduct
                fire scans.
            </p>
            <p>The prosses to get to the point of proposing this idea to NASA however was not simple. The first step was to reach the top 25 in 
                <a href="https://rocketcontest.org/">The American Rocketry Challenge</a>. A nation wide compotion were teams build small rockets carring an egg
            and launch them to specific altidudes. The closer you are to the directed altidude the better with top teams being off by less then a foot.
        The Animas Rocketry team has maniged to make it to the nationals of this compotion the past two years whith the most recent compotion being ranked high enough to submit
    our proposal to NASA.</p>
    <p>This proposal was accepted and alowed us to start working towards a high powered plane deploying rocket.</p>

        <header>Preliminary Deisgn Review</header>
        <div class="sidebyside">
            <p class="sidebysideobject">The first report after our proposal was excepted was called the Preliminary Deisgn Review. 
                This alowed us to show our more detailed design to NASA enginers to fix mager issues and alow us to get more view points.
                Around this time we added some yunger classmates to our team to help handle the work as this is generly a college level compotion. This Preliminary design Review
                consisted of a paper going over detial of our desing, the building prosses, and risks of all kinds. This was an eye opening experiance and realy helped us see
                the care that is placed into designs when in cooperation with other teams. In addtion we had to give a presentation and have a discution with NASA enginers. 
                We got a lot of feedback at this time and it helped allot with creating a safe rocket design.

        <header>The end</header>
        <div class="sidebyside">
            <p class="sidebysideobject">In the end our team of three seniors and two underclassmates was not enough to keep up with the work.
                While we were close our design for our supscale model was finished only four weeks before the launch deadline and aprently this is not enough
                time for parts to arive. At this point we had to leave the compotion as we could not build our rocket without parts but we still learn a lot.
                We created several prototypes of folding automimus planes desighed to be launched out of a rocket. We also learned that the disigh prosses
                takes a lot of time when working with orgnizations as it foced us to look over every detal and ensure safty. While in the end we did not compete we did learn a lot.
